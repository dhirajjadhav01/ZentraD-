Zentra D+ - Easy Attendance, a simple and intuitive web application built to streamline the process of tracking student attendance. This project reflects my continuous journey of learning and applying frontend technologies effectively.

 Key Features:

 Home Page: Clean interface introducing the app’s purpose and navigation.
 Student Page: Manage student information with clarity and ease.
 Attendance Page: Mark and track student attendance effortlessly.
Daily Lecture: Here you can upload lecture and download videos in sec.
Contact Page: Direct way to reach out for support or feedback.
 Sticky Footer: A minimal footer stating the app name "Easy Attendance" across all pages.
 No Backend Required: This web app is entirely frontend-driven, using only React and browser localStorage to store data—eliminating the need for any backend server or database.

  Functionality Implemented & Technologies Used:
To create a smooth and engaging user experience, I implemented several key functionalities using React and JavaScript​:
Component-Based Architecture: Leveraged React’s component system to build reusable, modular UI elements, which helps keep the code clean and maintainable.

React Router (v6): Used react-router-dom for seamless multi-page navigation without full page reloads, ensuring a fast and fluid user experience across Home, Student, Attendance, and Contact pages.

State Management with React Hooks: Utilized useState and useEffect hooks to manage dynamic data like attendance records and student information, enabling real-time updates and responsive UI behavior.

Event Handling: Incorporated event handlers in React to capture user interactions such as marking attendance, submitting forms, and navigating pages.

 Single-User Focus:
 Currently, Easy Attendance is designed for individual use—ideal for tutors or instructors to manage and track their own class attendance. It does not yet support multiple user accounts or student logins, so it’s not a multi-user system at this point.

 Behind the Name - Zentra D+
 The word Zentra is inspired by a blend of "centralized" and "zen", reflecting calmness, simplicity, and smart organization. The “D+” stands for my personal touch and dedication.
